# Hi there!

# I am interested in python, machine-learning and django.
# My eager to programming made me quit and leave previous industry
# which I had worked for almost 7 years and start a new profession.
# I have done some personal projects such as programs to:
  - estimate a car price by inputing car model, milage and date of manufacture
    by using python, mysql, web scraping and machine-learning algorithm
  - alarm user when price of some currency reaches a defined amount 
    by using python and websocket API technology
# Now I am looking for a job related to above-mentioned fields BUT the problem is 
# that I don't have related background to convince some company to accept me.
# That is so annoying. Changing profession is a big deal.
# I don't know how many people in the world made such decision as mine...

# BUT, Nevermind. All the world is an illusion and I wanna make my own illusion.
